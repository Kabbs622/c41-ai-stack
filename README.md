# C41 Cinema — Local AI Stack

Research, planning, and pitch materials for building a fully local AI content production setup for C41 Cinema.

## Key Documents

### The Stack
- **[c41-full-local-stack.md](c41-full-local-stack.md)** — The final plan. Full local stack, zero cloud, managed through OpenClaw. Hardware options, software architecture, ROI pitch.

### Research
- **[deep-practitioner-research.md](deep-practitioner-research.md)** — Real practitioner quotes from Reddit/GitHub. What people actually use in production across coding, video, image, audio, and orchestration.
- **[ai-models-complete-comparison.md](ai-models-complete-comparison.md)** — Every notable AI model compared. Cloud and local. Image, video, LLM.
- **[c41-model-recommendations.md](c41-model-recommendations.md)** — Focused recommendations by use case (LLM, code, photo, video, audio).

### Deep Dives
- **[local-ai-best-models-unconstrained.md](local-ai-best-models-unconstrained.md)** — Best models with no hardware constraints. Frontier MoE builds, real multi-GPU setups.
- **[local-ai-models-deep-dive.md](local-ai-models-deep-dive.md)** — 30+ source deep dive. Practitioner workflows, LoRA training, speed benchmarks.
- **[local-ai-models-first.md](local-ai-models-first.md)** — Models-first analysis with VRAM tables.

### Planning
- **[openclaw-local-setup-plan.md](openclaw-local-setup-plan.md)** — How OpenClaw orchestrates the full stack.
